thanks for buying my Add-on for /*AVATAR NAME*/. it means a lot to me

After importing the package in your unity project that has the model in it. please run the program in 
/*DIR PATCHER*/

after running it you should have a working prefab in:
/*DIR PREFAB*/



Import it into your scene, and voila!



Enjoy!
