Here's a cool description for my face tracking add-on for /*AVATAR AUTHOR*/'s /*AVATAR NAME*/
much swag, very bussin!

for this add-on to work you need to own /*AVATAR NAME*/ by /*AVATAR AUTHOR*/, avaliable @:
/*StoreLink*/

this DLC will only work if you use the package /*PACKAGE NAME*/ and have the model that comes with it in your unity project

after buying you'll get a program stored in
/*DIR PATCHER*/

after running it you should have a working prefab in:

/*DIR PREFAB*/

Import it into your scene, and voila!
