This is a simple tool to automate the ease the distribution and creation of face tracked avatars for VRChat.

Due to how curent 3D model files are set up there isn't a way to share shape-keys without being tied to a mesh. Making the process of sharing such files rather tedious or to be left to the context of a commision where sharing mesh data is in general allowed between the commisioner and the artist.


After being involved in the scene it was clear that the previous mainstream methods were sub optimal: overwriting the original model and requiering the user to navigate to a subfolder unknown in advanced.

My piece of software let's you build a patcher with ease, saving you time and letting your customers have a reliable path to navigate to. Building a reliable way for them to interact with your products.

I am going to be using my tool from now on to build my Face Tracking Add-ons avaliable on my [Booth](https://hashedits.booth.pm/) and [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hashedits/shop) shops

# Pre-requisites ü§ì

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

> pip install auto-py-to-exe

[Py Intsaller](https://pypi.org/project/auto-py-to-exe/)



>pip install pyinstaller

## How to use üòé
  
- Open your python IDLE

- Click File -> Open

- Navigate to where you have downloaded the repo -> FT_Builder

- Press F5

- Follow the instructions

## Exemple üìë
There is an extra theorical directory to show you what to expect from the builder if you input

"WhereverOnYourProjectIsLocatedOnYourDrive\ProjectName\Assets\CreatorName\AvatarName\fbx\MyCoolAvatar.fbx"
"WhereverOnYourProjectIsLocatedOnYourDrive\ProjectName\Assets\YourCustomDir\NameOfTheModel\fbx\MyCoolAvatar_FT.fbx"
YourCustomDir
NameOfTheModel
MyModelDiff
MyModelMetaDiff

## Distribute a face tracked avatar üë®‚Äçüè´
- Copy your custom generated directory earlier and drag and drop it in the Assets folder of your unity project

- Make sure that your avatar has the required parameters, FX and additive controllers set up for VRCFaceTracking.
(The use of [Jerry's template](https://github.com/Adjerry91/VRCFaceTracking-Templates) highly recomended)

- Make sure the avatar works in game
(would recommend using meowface, the very easy to use [Meowface](https://github.com/regzo2/VRCFaceTracking-MeowFace))
(or [LiveLink](https://github.com/kusomaigo/VRCFaceTracking-LiveLink) if you're Apple flavoured)

(If it doesn't check for potential avatar animation overwrite conflicts in your animators)

- Create a prefab
(this is done by dragging your avatar from your hierarchy to a prefab folder in the folder you generated for your avatar)

- Select your custom folder

- Right click

- Export Package

- Deselect your Face Tracked FBX

- Deselect any of the avatar's original files

- Click "Export..."

- You're ready to sell your custom face tracked avatar!
(make sure to always check the creator's licence agreement on attachements)
  

## Build FT_Builder

Somehow running into issues with that, it ends up restarting the script uppon wanting to run pyinstaller from the script (line 121), if any of you have an idea how to build the daim thing I'd be glad to merge it to the main branch ü§ó
