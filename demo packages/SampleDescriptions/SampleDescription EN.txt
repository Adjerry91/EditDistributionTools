plz buy my kewl modification of /*AVATAR NAME*/

you can get the original moddel by /*AVATAR AUTHOR*/ at /*StoreLink*/

you need to have this sepcific version of the package: /*PACKAGE NAME*/

once you have the original package and my package imported,
go at the top of your unity window and go to /*DIR PATCHER*/ and click patch

once that is done, drag and drop the prefab located at /*DIR PATCHER*/ in your scene

and enjoy :)
