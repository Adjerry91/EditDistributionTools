plz buy my kewl modification of BlenderCube

you can get the original moddel by Deez at deez.booth.pm

you need to have this sepcific version of the package: SampleCube v1.0.unitypackage

once you have the original package and my package imported,
go at the top of your unity window and go to Tools/Hash/BlenderCubePatcher and click patch

once that is done, drag and drop the prefab located at Tools/Hash/BlenderCubePatcher in your scene

and enjoy :)
